# Appliance-Energy-Prediction
This project uses an LSTM-based model implemented in Google Colab to forecast appliance energy usage from environmental and time-based features. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Ideal for exploring time-series prediction with TensorFlow and Colab.
